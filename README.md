How to use:
Type one of these commands in the chat to toggle the hack.
*invisible
*inv

Now once you die you will not see the death screen.
After dying relog for you to be able to load chunks, see entities, attack entities etc.
If you want to respawn toggle the hack off and relog and you will see the death screen.

Some entities may not render.
Some player data might not be updated correctly while invincibility mode is active. (such as hunger)
You cannot pickup items. (you can take items out of chests or any other container though)
Mobs will not attack you.
Does NOT work on papermc.
